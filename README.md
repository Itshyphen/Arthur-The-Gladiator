# ARTHUR , THE GLADIATOR

This project is the game made using the data structures and algorithms, divided into three levels with each level using one algorithm.


# Algorithms Used
**Dijkstra Algorithm**     
**Breadth First Search Algorithm**
**Quick sort and Merge sort**

## Game Idea

**Arthur** , the player of the game is in the quest of the princesses kidnapped by the evil monsters. We have to help the Arthur to find the princesses using different shortest path finding algorithms in three different world.

## Level 1, The Jungle Path
- Motive of this level to rescue the princess crossing through the jungle 
- Need to find the shortest path to save moves. 
- Need to kill monsters to gain lives and make sure not to get eaten by any one of them. 
- Immunity increases moves and bombs are available to demolish the obstacles. 
- **[Dijkstra Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)** is used for providing hint for the shortest path.

## Level 2, Knight Move

- Motive of this level to rescue the princess moving in a knight path 
- Need to find the shortest path to save moves 
- Need to kill monsters to gain lives and make sure not to get eaten by any one of them. 
- **[Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)** is used for providing hint in this level.

## Level 3, Princess in the Box

- Motive of this level is to rescue the princess from inside a box 
- Need to find the required box using as few moves as possible 
- Sorting can be done in either order to achieve that result. 
- **[Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)** and **[Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)** are used for the sorting process
